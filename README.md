In this homework assignment, I'm creating an interactive Guessing game with Python. 
Here's my guide: https://djangocentral.com/creating-a-guessing-game-in-python/

# About my Game
In this simple guessing game, the computer will generate a random number between 1 and 10, and the user has to guess it in 3 attempts. 

The computer will give the user hints based on if the user's guess is high or low. 

Once the user's guess matches the computer's chosen number, the code will print the answer and number of attempts.
